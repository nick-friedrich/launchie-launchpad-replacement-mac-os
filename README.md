The Launchpad Replacement macOS 26 Deserves

Apple removed icon rearranging and folders from Launchpad in macOS 26 Tahoe. Launchie brings back the power and adds even more control to your app launching experience.

## V 1.0:


### What's working

- CMD + Shift + Space to Open/Close
- Setting custom hotkey
- Esc to Close
- Drag and Drop to reorder apps

- Folders
- Search

It is my first MacOS App so be kind :)
