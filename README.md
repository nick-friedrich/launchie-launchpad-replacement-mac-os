The Launchpad Replacement macOS 26 Deserves

Apple removed icon rearranging and folders from Launchpad in macOS 26 Tahoe. Launchie brings back the power and adds even more control to your app launching experience.

This Repo only contains the app and not the source code. I am offering the app here for free, but it will also be released on the Mac Appstore. 
I am not sharing the code, because i don't want to get ripped of by other people, who steal code and sell it as their own.

## V 1.0.3:
- Fixed a lot of issues with performance and some minor bugs.

## V 1.0:

### What's working

- CMD + Shift + Space to Open/Close
- Setting custom hotkey
- Esc to Close
- Drag and Drop to reorder apps
- Open Apps
- Folders
- Search


It is my first MacOS App so be kind :) 
If you find anything not working, open a issue here on Github.
